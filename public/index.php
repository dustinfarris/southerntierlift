        <p>We have a fleet of fully stocked service trucks that are ready to assist with the maintenance 
        and repair of forklifts regardless of make or model. Our area of service is from Corning to Oneonta
         and Binghamton to Syracuse. We chose this area because our fleet is backed by a garage that repairs
          anything that can not be repaired in the field of service.</p>
        <p>Whether you need <a href="./training.php">OSHA certification</a>, <a href="./trucks.php">used or new forklifts</a>

        running in optimal condition again.</p>
